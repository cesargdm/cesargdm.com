I've been working with pnpm for a couple of months now and all I can say is that is marvelous, firstly the gains in disk usage, offline cache and seep are incomparable.

The only downside is the dependency resolver, where npm will show a lot of warnings and sometimes errors for peer dependencies that are not installed. And that still happens for a lot of libraries where peer dependencies should be marked as regular dependencies.

```bash
npm install --global pnpm
```

Upgrading dependencies is really easy. While running

```bash
pnpm upgrade --latest --interactive # or 'pnpm up -iL' for short
```

You will get a fully interactive viewer for your outdated depedencies, link to the repo to make sure the update does not bring any breaking changes.
