Whenever you are just starting out with programming, you have switched to VS Code or even if you already have experience with VS Code, we all may want to discover or rediscover tools that will make us more productive and confident when writing code.

## ESLint and Prettier

This is a very basic tool that will help us to write code in a more consistent way.

## Import Cost

When working on frontend code we should be cautious about the amount of code we are importing, popular but large libraries like lodash or moment.js are still spotted in the wild.

## GitLens

Working with a large project with different contributors, a large history of commits, and a large amount of code, GitLens is a great tool to help us to see the history of our code, blame anyone who has messed up the code (it usually is yourself) and see the history of the code in a more readable way, navigate tru last PRs and more.

## CodeMetrics

We always know when our code stinks, but CodeMetrics will make it clear when we are not following the best practices.

## Code Spell Checker

## Bonus

## GitHub Copilot
