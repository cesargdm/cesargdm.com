# They Xolo

They Xolo is a NFT collection in the Ethereum blockchain. Created with the artist [@maria*azuli*](https://twitter.com/maria_azuli_) and me.

We aimed to create a collection that represented the diversity of the Mexican culture. For the website it was develoepd focused on being mobile first, supporting english and spanish, light and dark mode, and accessibility navigation features.

## Smart Contract

I developed an extension for the ERC721A contract, I called it ERC721X (for Xolo :P) it allows an allow list for a presale, royality per token information and contract URI.

## Profile explorer

Connects to your ens profile and shows your NFTs by connecting to the OpenSea API and The Graph API.

You can edit your profile and it will send edit transactions to ens supporting multi-call transactions.

For this, I developed an API in The Graph that connects to the contract and gets the token information and supports multiple filters.

## Wallet

Gets token balances from the blockchain and shows them in a nice way.
