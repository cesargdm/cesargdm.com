# C Chess

This is a simple implementation of a chess board in C programming language. It was made as a project for a C programming course.

The game is played in the terminal, and it has a simple AI that can play against you. The game is played by entering the coordinates of the piece you want to move and the coordinates of the destination.

The game has a simple checkmate detection, and it can detect when the game is over.
